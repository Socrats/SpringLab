# spring-lab

# Method 1
Here class A instantiates class B on its contructor. To try this method run class App on pl.agh.edu.springtest.method1

# Method 2
Here we use and Interface and a Helper class to make the process of changing from an object B to C easier and to be able to not modify A.

# Method 3
Here we use Spring. In this way to enable the class A to use either B or C we just need to modify some lines of and XML file and this can be done even during execution time.
