# SpringLab

## Method 1
Here class A instantiates class B on its contructor. To try this method run class App on pl.agh.edu.springlab.method1

## Method 2
Here we use and Interface and a Helper class to make the process of changing from an object B to C easier and to be able to not modify A. To run this method run class App on pl.agh.edu.springlab.method2.

## Method 3
Here we use Spring. In this way to enable the class A to use either B or C we just need to modify some lines of and XML file and this can be done even during execution time. To run this method run class App on pl.agh.edu.springlab.method3.
